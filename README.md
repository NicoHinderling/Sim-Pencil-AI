Sim-Pencil-AI
=============

About the Game:
---------------
Sim is a game where players take turns drawing lines from point to point. The object of the game is to avoid making a triangle with your own lines. The objective of Sim Pencil AI was to create a "Computer Player" (Source Code) that a human could play against. In order to make a decision, the computer would use a MinMax tree to gauge the possible outcomes a couple of moves ahead. This project was a fun application of MinMax trees and my first attempt at Artifical Intelligence.
